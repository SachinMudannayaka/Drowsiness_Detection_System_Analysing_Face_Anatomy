Drowsiness Detection System: Analysing Face Anatomy

This project is a Drowsiness Detection System designed to help reduce accidents caused by driver fatigue. The system uses advanced computer vision techniques to monitor facial features and detect signs of drowsiness in real time.

Key Features

Face Detection: Utilizes a pre-trained Haar Cascade model (haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml) to detect faces.
Facial Landmark Detection: Employs shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat to analyze key facial points.
Drowsiness Alerts: Includes visual and sound alerts to warn the user when drowsiness is detected.
Accident Prevention: Aimed at mitigating accidents caused by drowsy driving through real-time monitoring.
Technologies Used
OpenCV
Dlib
Python

This project was developed with the goal of enhancing road safety and leveraging AI-powered solutions to save lives.
